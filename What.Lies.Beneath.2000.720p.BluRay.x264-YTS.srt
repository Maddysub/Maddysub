00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,268
Good morning, beauty.

2
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,024
Let's go, or we'll never
leave on time.

3
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,485
I'm totally ready.

4
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,238
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.

5
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,032
- Mother...
- Caitlin.

6
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,034
Blueberries!

7
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,662
Hey, Cooper.

8
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,539
You want some breakfast too?

9
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,291
You want some waffles?

10
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,251
Good boy.

11
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,404
Look. They're at it again.

12
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,531
Christ, that's twice in...

13
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,408
When did they move in?

14
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,869
Three weeks. What's their name?

15
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,915
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.

16
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,091
She's awake.

17
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,885
We'll be quiet.

18
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,345
Quick and quiet.

19
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,390
I don't want to be either.

20
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,230
- When's she out of here?
- Norman Spencer!

21
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,734
All right, I can't stand
the rejection. I'm going for a run.

22
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,612
Hey, you okay?

23
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,447
Yeah.

24
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,493
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.

25
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,497
We'll have to leave by 11
if we want to beat the traffic.

26
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,333
Eleven o'clock.

27
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,112
You know, you can call me...

28
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,197
...whenever you want.

29
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,241
Sweetheart...

30
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,078
...I've known this day was coming
for a long time.

31
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,248
I have Norman, and the garden
and the new house.

32
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,125
You really don't have to worry.

33
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,502
- I'm just saying...
- Really.

34
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,212
Okay.

35
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,635
Mom?

36
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,139
Mother?

37
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,392
I have to go.

38
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,858
Honey, if I don't get you out of here
quick, they'll make you enroll.

39
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,943
I'll call you.

40
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

41
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,572
Come home often.

42
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,074
Call your mom.

43
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,618
Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.

44
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,455
- You take care of each other.
- I won't go to a bar without her.

45
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,248
I'm just kidding.

46
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,377
Bye.

47
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,636
Well, I almost made it.

48
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,497
What are you reading?

49
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,835
<i>"Genetic Repair Mechanisms
in Eukaryotic Organisms."</i>

50
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,254
Eukaryotic. How is it?

51
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,131
Excellent.

52
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,716
Oh, a couple of...

53
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,139
...Swedish sailor cells just gang-
divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

54
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,894
Almost there.

55
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,569
- If you have to work...
- No, no. Just let me get this.

56
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay, almost.

57
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,742
There.

58
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,245
How's it going?

59
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,081
Great. I think we cracked it.

60
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,250
The prenatal thing?

61
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,836
Yeah, I targeted repair.

62
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,965
You are so brilliant.

63
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,217
Yep.

64
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,886
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk...

65
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,263
...Norman Spencer.

66
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,102
How are you?

67
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,896
I'm fine.

68
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,732
I am. Yeah, really.

69
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,068
It's okay if you're not, you know.

70
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,613
To tell you the truth, I'm...

71
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,448
...excited.

72
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,241
Really?

73
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,245
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.

74
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,498
Some time for us.

75
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,879
Did a great job.

76
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,839
She's a good kid.

77
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,633
We did.

78
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,432
Just us now.

79
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,519
I know.

80
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,606
Tired?

81
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,901
Nope.

82
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,112
Want to fool around?

83
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,906
Yep.

84
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,684
Jesus.

85
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,899
What is he doing to her?

86
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,277
- I guess they're making up.
- Wait.

87
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,487
Leave it open.

88
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,157
Think we can take 'em?

89
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,659
It's worth a try.

90
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,677
Do the brilliant Norman stuff
some more.

91
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,436
And speak up.

92
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,418
Hello?

93
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,637
Hello?

94
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,937
Mrs. Feur?

95
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,027
Hello?

96
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,988
Are you all right?

97
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,495
He's so...

98
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,622
It's too much...

99
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,791
...and I can't...

100
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,418
I can't breathe.

101
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,796
And I'm afraid.

102
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,048
What? What are you afraid of?

103
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,551
That one day I'll just...

104
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,678
...disappear.

105
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,682
Is there something I can do?

106
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,016
Can I...?

107
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,435
I've never even met you.

108
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,271
I know. I'm sorry.

109
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,397
I've been consumed.

110
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,525
This fence...

111
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,777
...it's so...

112
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,283
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like
to come over for coffee, or...?

113
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,285
Oh, God, he's back.

114
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,288
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.

115
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,165
I don't even know you!
Please!

116
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,061
<i>She sounded...</i>

117
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,855
- ...terrified.
- Of what?

118
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,773
Of him, I think.

119
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,150
Did she say that?

120
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,110
More or less.

121
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,488
I want to go over there.
Let's go and...

122
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,365
- Why?
- To see if she's all right...

123
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,786
Honey, we're not going to march over
to our new neighbors and accuse them...

124
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:16,499
- That's not what I'm suggesting.
- Especially since they'll keep us up...

125
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,043
...with their sexual Olympics.

126
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,045
What if something happened to her?

127
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,505
- Nothing will happen.
- I'd never forgive...

128
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,383
Honey, people argue.

129
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,385
People fight.

130
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,430
It's not our business.

131
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,276
- I've got to work tonight.
- I know.

132
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,906
This conference is the first
big preview of my paper.

133
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,909
I've just got to stay focused
a little while longer.

134
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,913
This is what I've been working for.

135
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,499
I just wish you could have heard her.

136
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,167
I'll tell you what I'll do.

137
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,420
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow
in the psych department...

138
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,549
...and I'll see what I can
find out about him.

139
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,301
Promise?

140
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,178
Yeah, I promise.

141
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,694
Hey, lady!

142
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,738
What are you doing?

143
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,240
Looking for you.

144
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,368
What are you doing?

145
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,247
Just trying to drop off this
welcome thing for the new neighbors.

146
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,498
Not home?

147
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,000
Guess not.

148
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,004
- You are so good at this.
- If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.

149
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,340
I gave my neighbors wine
that someone left at my house.

150
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,594
- Are you staying?
- Just came by to see how you're doing.

151
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
Good. I'm good.

152
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,015
Are you?

153
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,103
Why does everyone
find that so surprising?

154
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,981
Because your only daughter
just left for college...

155
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,442
...who you're extremely close with.

156
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,943
I'd be tripping.

157
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,111
Oh, right.

158
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,990
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house...

159
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,200
...the garden.

160
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,493
The car.

161
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,620
A minor setback.

162
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,996
Was that a year ago?

163
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,498
This week.

164
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,124
Wow. Now Caitlin.

165
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,626
Big stress stuff.

166
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,252
Okay.

167
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,962
I'm a little tender.

168
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,215
Good. You're human.

169
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,094
And so far this week, my big task
is to take pictures of my roses...

170
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,012
...for the garden club.

171
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,766
Got here just in time, didn't I?

172
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,518
Brought you something.

173
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,728
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.

174
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,689
It soothes heartache
and promotes psychic wellness.

175
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,193
- Floriana suggested it.
- So you discuss me with your psychic?

176
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,613
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.

177
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:34,864
Like me.

178
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,867
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.

179
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,705
Notice anything different?

180
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,750
Oh, my God. You bought it!

181
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,086
Nice.

182
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,755
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.

183
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,257
You lose a husband...

184
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,008
...get a car.

185
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,511
- Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
- Absolutely.

186
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,887
Cool.

187
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,223
I have to run. You take care.

188
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,100
Thanks for the tea.

189
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,264
Norman.

190
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,518
Norman.

191
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,353
- Norman!
- What?

192
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,731
Come here. You have to see this.

193
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,237
- What's the matter?
- Look.

194
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,243
What, Claire?

195
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,123
I thought I saw...

196
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,500
- I...
- What?

197
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,629
- I thought I saw something.
- Jesus Christ!

198
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,364
Hi, is Caitlin there?

199
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,242
Any idea when she'll be back?

200
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,123
You be sure to tell her I called?

201
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,958
Thanks, Beatrice.

202
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,503
Well, that's a first.

203
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,589
Cooper, come on.

204
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,257
Get your ball.

205
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,218
What's the matter?

206
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,222
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.

207
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,514
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

208
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,892
<i>I'm stuck here for another
couple of hours. Sorry.</i>

209
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,520
<i>Unless you want me to come home?</i>

210
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,856
No. No, it's fine.

211
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,358
<i>You sure?</i>

212
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,613
<i>Claire?</i>

213
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,742
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.

214
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,494
<i>See you soon. Love you.</i>

215
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,579
Love you. Bye.

216
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,631
Cooper!

217
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,512
Cooper!

218
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,645
Fine. Have it your way.

219
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,203
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.

220
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,747
Halothane? Is that a sedative?

221
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,207
It's a dissociative.

222
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,460
It paralyzes motor function,
but leaves her conscious.

223
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,379
She can't move,
but knows what's going on.

224
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,965
- Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
- Hi, Teddy.

225
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,594
- How long does that last?
- Five minutes.

226
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,388
- Sometimes three.
- Can it be used on all mammals?

227
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,768
Yeah, any procedure where you want to
get the patient immobile, pain-free.

228
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,979
Hi. What are you doing here?

229
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,314
- Are you okay?
- I...

230
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,733
I heard noises.

231
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,612
- What kind of noises? Where?
- At the house. I was scared.

232
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,073
- Did you call the police?
- No.

233
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,992
I'll have the police
check on the house while I'm gone.

234
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,744
Oh, great.

235
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,706
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices."

236
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,583
Wait till that gets around.

237
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,128
I'll be in New Haven for the
conference. I want you to feel safe.

238
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,713
I do.

239
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,591
I'm sure it was just...

240
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,010
...nothing.

241
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,889
Did you call about the Feurs?

242
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,016
Oh, yeah.

243
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,145
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.

244
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,815
Warren. Warren Feur.

245
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,817
What about her?

246
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,112
I know he told me...

247
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,200
I met Schumway today.

248
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,619
Who wrote that book you love.

249
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,498
They were doing some spiel
for the chemistry department...

250
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,709
...so Bob Shine introduces us.

251
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,504
You'll love this.
He looks right at me...

252
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,257
...and congratulates me
on Spencer's Theorem.

253
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,010
He didn't know your father was dead?

254
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,511
He knew.

255
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,642
What?

256
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,145
You're so sensitive about that.

257
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,646
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

258
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,857
You always overreact.

259
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,737
I'll have to watch that, won't I?

260
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,706
Was it Mary?

261
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,124
Mrs. Feur.

262
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,752
Warren and Mary?

263
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,379
Yeah.

264
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,131
Mary. That's it.

265
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,509
I'm gonna do some work.

266
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,359
Hello?

267
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,070
Mrs. Feur?

268
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,731
Can I help you?

269
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,983
Oh, yes.

270
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,569
Hi.

271
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,365
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.

272
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,450
Nice to meet you.

273
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,246
I wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

274
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,127
Thank you, but this really isn't
a good time. I'm running late.

275
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,463
Is your wife home?

276
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,258
No, she isn't.

277
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,511
When will she be back?

278
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,638
I have to go.

279
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,641
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

280
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:00,943
<i>What's he doing?</i>

281
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,236
Eating dinner.

282
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,612
Alone.

283
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,739
TV dinner.

284
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,366
<i>That's bad.</i>

285
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,244
<i>That's my shiatsu guy.</i>

286
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:14,373
<i>Listen, call me back if he starts in
on some serial-killer dessert...</i>

287
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,375
<i>...like ladyfingers.</i>

288
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,961
- You got it.
<i>- Bye.</i>

289
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:22,882
Where did you go?

290
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,254
Shit!

291
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,494
Jesus, Claire.

292
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,621
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was looking...

293
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,623
- Spying.
- Spying on Mr. Feur.

294
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,750
- How come you're not dressed?
- Dressed?

295
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,877
Dinner with Stan.

296
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,879
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

297
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,091
- We're going to be...
- Fashionably five minutes late.

298
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,260
Are you saying he murdered his wife?

299
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,512
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified...

300
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,974
...and now she doesn't answer
the door, but her car's in the garage.

301
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,852
Maybe she was out,
or in bed with the flu.

302
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,188
- Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
- Who are you calling?

303
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,817
- Restaurant.
- We're not at the center of the bridge.

304
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,069
You can't get service
until the center.

305
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,739
I know we're not at the center.

306
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,451
There. See?

307
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,370
Well, that's a relief.

308
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,496
Hi, Stan.

309
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,124
Hey, Claire. Norman.

310
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,460
- Sorry we're late.
- It's my fault.

311
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,753
We just got here.

312
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,547
- Where's the new squeeze?
- Here I am.

313
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,299
- This is...
- Elena?

314
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,009
Oh, my God. Claire!

315
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,178
I don't believe it!

316
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,182
- This is...
- We know each other.

317
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,809
- Norman.
- Hello, Norman. How do you do?

318
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,436
Claire, look at you!

319
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,271
You look beautiful.

320
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:29,109
Here was this brilliant conductor
in purple bikini briefs...

321
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,653
...with no bangs...

322
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:36,366
...cursing his ass off in Finnish.

323
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,535
Oh, Claire.

324
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,163
I made an honest woman of her.

325
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,665
How long have you been in Vermont?

326
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,876
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.

327
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:51,048
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio
at the hospital? He was just sacked.

328
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,550
I just dropped her off at college.

329
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:57,054
He was involved in some stalking
incident. An intern, some girl.

330
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,555
We're getting so old!

331
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,809
They don't screw around
with that anymore.

332
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:06,355
- When did we last get together?
- New York.

333
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,358
- Of course. Right after...
- Right after Michael died.

334
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,026
- Michael who?
- Marlov.

335
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,986
Claire's first husband.

336
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,863
- Oh, the musician.
- Yeah.

337
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,032
You know, we all toured together.

338
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,369
Have you heard her play?

339
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,870
No.

340
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:27,543
I would sit on-stage...

341
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,921
...during Claire's solo...

342
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,259
...and I mean, truly, I had tears
streaming down my face.

343
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,553
I mean, she's fabulous.

344
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,429
So why did you stop?

345
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,018
Well, one night, after a concert...

346
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,772
...I met a dashing, handsome...

347
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:52,025
...genius scientist...

348
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:56,029
...and three months later,
I was married.

349
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,909
Is that when you guys
moved up to Vermont?

350
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,288
No, we were living in Boston...

351
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,665
...when Norman was offered a position.

352
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,250
A position.

353
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,128
The DuPont Chair in genetics.

354
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,924
I see. So now you're teaching
at your father's school here.

355
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,801
I actually don't...

356
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,887
...do much teaching anymore.

357
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,181
I run a research project.

358
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,522
Norman's father had this old stuffy...

359
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,650
...stately place on a lake.

360
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,653
- Which we're renovating.
- Practically gutted.

361
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,280
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

362
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,531
"Gutted."

363
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,411
- Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
- It is beautiful. You'll see it.

364
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,413
It's haunted.

365
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,040
No.

366
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,374
Is it really?

367
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,501
Claire's hearing things.

368
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,254
What? What are you hearing?

369
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,138
I don't know. I heard...

370
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,682
...voices, whispering...

371
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,018
A picture fell.

372
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,688
You know, I completely believe
in all that.

373
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,398
You do?

374
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:14,650
I do.

375
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,277
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?

376
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,031
I know exactly who it is.

377
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,243
It's my old man.

378
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,371
He's pissed about us
dicking around with the house.

379
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,898
Claire.

380
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,775
Jesus...

381
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,902
It's all right.

382
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,030
Calm down, Claire.

383
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,907
It's okay.

384
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,419
Whose idea was it?

385
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,254
Mine. His.

386
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,381
We both thought...

387
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,426
I didn't want to come here.

388
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,137
- Then why did you?
- He was worried about me.

389
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,680
- Your husband?
- Yes.

390
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,934
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me
full of Prozac or lithium...

391
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,187
...so he can live out his life
in peace.

392
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,397
- Do you really think so?
- No.

393
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,107
Are you on medication?

394
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,027
No. Well, Valium.

395
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,612
For sleeping.

396
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,155
Having trouble sleeping?

397
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,907
Sometimes.

398
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,783
When I get anxious.

399
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,912
Do you get anxious only at night?

400
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,540
No, I only take Valium at night.

401
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,292
For sleeping.

402
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,545
Why do you get anxious?

403
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,672
I don't know.

404
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,425
Why do you think
your husband's worried?

405
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,427
Because...

406
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,305
I don't know.

407
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:59,684
Because ever since Caitlin left...

408
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:03,021
Ever since my daughter left
for school...

409
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,524
...there have been...

410
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,236
I've been...

411
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,530
Why is this so hard?

412
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,783
Here. Have a fireball.

413
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,038
Thank you.

414
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,542
It's hard because I'm
a complete stranger...

415
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,670
...and you're talking about
incredibly personal things.

416
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,508
Besides, most people, when they
come the first time, are wondering...

417
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,302
...if I think they're crazy.

418
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,930
Don't worry. I'm required...

419
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,808
...to have three sessions
before I can commit.

420
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,311
That was a joke.

421
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,739
These are good. They're hot.

422
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,618
There's a ghost in my house.

423
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,916
I saw her in the water, beside me...

424
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,376
...in the bathtub.

425
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,169
What does she look like?

426
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,424
She looked like...

427
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,800
...me.

428
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:19,431
Only she had green eyes.

429
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,183
Any idea who she is?

430
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:26,688
Maybe. But I'd rather not say
just yet.

431
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,023
Fine.

432
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,490
What do you think I should do?

433
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,034
Try to contact her.

434
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:43,663
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.

435
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,543
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?

436
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:57,302
Are we hoping the ghost
will have to use the potty?

437
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,054
This is where she was.

438
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,388
This is where I...

439
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,556
...saw her.

440
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,266
That makes sense.

441
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,186
- Where did you finally find one?
- Kmart.

442
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:10,649
I think we're supposed to sit
in a protective circle, aren't we?

443
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:11,900
What's that for?

444
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,278
- Where did you get it?
- Never mind.

445
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,405
You stole her shoe.

446
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:21,034
You have to have something
of the dead woman's.

447
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,160
Says who?

448
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,537
Is that blood on it?

449
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:28,917
I don't know. Just place your fingers
on the message indicator.

450
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,044
Okay.

451
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,807
We wish to commune...

452
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,433
...with the spirit...

453
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,895
What?

454
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,605
"Wish to commune."

455
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,524
- Forget it.
- What?

456
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,151
No, this whole thing is insane.

457
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,528
I'm sorry.

458
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,030
What's her first name?

459
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:02,909
Mary.

460
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,537
Feur.

461
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,916
Mary Feur, Mary Feur...

462
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,506
We wish to communicate...

463
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,051
...with the spirit of Mary Feur.

464
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,519
Not much happening.

465
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,802
What was that?

466
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,306
It's flickering.

467
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,559
Yeah.

468
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,664
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

469
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,408
Cooper!

470
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,036
<i>Listen...</i>

471
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,039
...about our little séance.

472
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,124
Norman doesn't need to know.

473
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,253
- I won't tell if you won't.
- It's just that...

474
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:21,422
...ever since the accident...

475
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,550
...he treats me like I'm this...

476
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,427
...fragile, loopy...

477
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:30,014
Well, I am seeing ghosts
in the bathtub, aren't I?

478
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:33,518
You did wrap your car around a tree
doing, like, 80.

479
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,312
He was pretty shaken up.

480
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,732
- We all were.
- It was an accident. A year ago.

481
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,901
I'm fine.

482
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,903
Right?

483
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,158
Of course you are.

484
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:54,038
You're just not much of a medium,
however.

485
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,624
I'll call you tomorrow.

486
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,001
Get some rest.

487
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,003
Did you pick up any dudes yet?

488
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,130
I have one in the trunk.

489
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,759
Bye.

490
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,785
What do you want?

491
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,239
She's dead.

492
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,159
- Who's dead?
- You know damn well who's dead.

493
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,410
The Feur thing.

494
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,620
Listen to me.

495
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,164
He killed her and I'm not crazy.

496
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:27,043
Jody and I had a séance in the
bathroom, and nothing happened...

497
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,755
...but when I went back there
she was there. She was.

498
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:32,799
Wait a minute.

499
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,551
You had a séance?

500
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,890
- Are you angry with me?
- What?

501
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,645
- Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
- No.

502
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,525
You know what I've got at stake for
this paper. How important it is to me.

503
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:54,612
I can't help feeling that you're
trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.

504
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,656
Norman, this isn't about you.

505
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,783
Something is happening to me.

506
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:03,871
And it's not to get even, and it's
not some warped bid for attention.

507
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:08,751
Something is happening in our house,
whether you like it or not.

508
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:12,421
Claire.

509
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:14,924
Claire, stop.

510
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,300
You're overreacting.

511
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,427
Don't tell me how to react.

512
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,305
- Will you keep your voice down?
- I will not!

513
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,682
Maybe you're right.

514
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,809
Maybe I am losing my mind.

515
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,686
But what if I'm not?

516
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,521
What if she died...

517
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,897
...some horrible death?

518
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,983
Can we please not do this here?

519
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,901
Oh, wow.

520
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,408
You.

521
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,618
You think you're smart, don't you?

522
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,495
You think you got away with it.

523
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,541
Well, I know you killed her,
you murdering son of a bitch!

524
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:49,750
Who?

525
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,419
Don't give me that shit.

526
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,504
Your wife.

527
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,674
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.

528
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:58,009
Honey.

529
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,512
I didn't kill my wife.

530
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,432
Are you all right?

531
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,519
Come on, honey.

532
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,982
Come on. Let's go.

533
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:14,901
I'm sorry.

534
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,244
You all right?

535
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,621
Oh. Yeah.

536
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,372
I'm fine.

537
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,000
What happened? Just now?

538
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,295
I just saw Norman's face.

539
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:39,425
He was so frightened for me.

540
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,927
How's your marriage?

541
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,889
Good. Really good.

542
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,309
We've had our moments, I guess...

543
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,687
...but he's a wonderful husband
and father.

544
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,483
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed
with his work...

545
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,152
...and sometimes it's like...

546
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,657
...that he doesn't see me.

547
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,159
Or, you know...

548
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,994
...like I'm...

549
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,249
That there's something wrong...

550
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,626
...with me.

551
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,421
That can't feel good.

552
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,548
No.

553
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,307
Okay.

554
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,560
I see where you're going with this...

555
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:34,772
...but my marriage is fine. No.

556
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:39,277
I have had some kind of
empty-nest episode...

557
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:42,154
...where I saw...

558
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:45,366
...some things that weren't there.

559
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,413
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.

560
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,236
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody."

561
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:43,924
Mrs. Spencer.

562
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:49,555
I wanted to apologize
for scaring you like I did.

563
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,183
When I thought about
how it must have seemed...

564
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:55,061
Please. Let's just...

565
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,649
Claire Spencer.

566
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,610
Mary Feur.

567
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,988
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Very much.

568
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:08,616
<i>That day at the fence...</i>

569
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,160
...you seemed terrified.

570
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,163
I don't think I imagined that.

571
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,748
No.

572
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,626
What were you so afraid of?

573
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:25,174
Have you ever felt so completely
consumed by a feeling for someone...

574
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,135
...that you couldn't breathe?

575
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,806
Thought that your time together
was so...

576
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:35,935
...passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they'd leave?

577
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,605
Sure.

578
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,774
I couldn't catch my breath...

579
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,401
...and I panicked.

580
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,654
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.

581
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,241
I tried to leave him.

582
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,661
I went to my mother's in Providence...

583
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,746
...but he brought my things up...

584
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,165
...in the middle of the night...

585
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,292
...during the rainstorm.

586
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,878
He pleaded with me to come home.

587
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,797
You must think I'm pathetic.

588
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,674
No.

589
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,510
I don't.

590
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:15,182
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon
to okay my budget before his trip.

591
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,810
What's Templeton's wife's name again?

592
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,146
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.

593
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:23,899
Don't let her corner you,
she'll chew your ear off.

594
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,609
- Evening, Phil.
- Here they are.

595
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,111
How do you do? Hi.

596
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:30,406
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.

597
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,167
White wine, please.

598
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,299
How are you holding up?

599
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,135
Just fine. It's a lovely party.

600
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,555
Norman was telling me the house
is finished.

601
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,016
- Almost.
- Wonderful.

602
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,810
It's good to see you doing so well.

603
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,187
Thank you.

604
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,731
Well, I was worried.

605
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:50,110
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.

606
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,987
You were worried?

607
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:57,409
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.

608
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,037
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.

609
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,916
You got so upset.

610
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,669
Oh, at the party.

611
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,046
For the DuPont Chair.

612
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,631
You remember?

613
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,509
Well, I remember the party, but...

614
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,429
Oh, God!

615
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,017
I had completely forgotten.

616
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,811
I broke your crystal.

617
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,271
Oh, my dear.

618
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,232
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.

619
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:32,027
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.

620
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:35,239
It was as if you had seen a ghost.

621
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,161
"Missing girl."

622
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,751
Madison Elizabeth.

623
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,421
M-E.

624
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:47,311
Frank.

625
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:50,397
Madison Elizabeth...

626
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,524
...Frank.

627
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,279
M-E-F.

628
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,651
Claire?

629
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,739
Hey, good morning.

630
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:45,619
Up all night?

631
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:47,788
You okay?

632
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,797
Do you remember this?

633
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,557
It's the girl that disappeared
last year.

634
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,060
Did you know her?

635
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:11,687
No.

636
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,488
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.

637
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,033
Where's all this going?

638
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,286
It's her.

639
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,040
The woman I saw in the bathtub.

640
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,751
- The ghost?
- Yes, the ghost.

641
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,794
I thought it was Mrs. Feur,
but it's not.

642
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,629
I'm positive this time.

643
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,298
Claire, stop it!

644
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,508
Stop it.

645
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:47,431
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.

646
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,811
I have tried to be here for you,
but this is enough, Claire.

647
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,438
Enough.

648
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,025
Do you want to go see somebody
together?

649
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,152
I'll call Dr. Drayton.

650
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,282
Then what, Claire? What?

651
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,618
Tell me what to do.

652
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:09,787
It's her.

653
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,875
So let me ask you this...
Mr. McCain?

654
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,044
<i>- McCann.</i>
- McCann.

655
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,800
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or...?

656
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,428
<i>Listen...
This girl's a real live wire.</i>

657
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:30,766
<i>She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.</i>

658
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,434
<i>Most people think she's...</i>

659
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,647
<i>...off around Mexico or somewhere
with her friends.</i>

660
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:40,234
<i>The police downgraded it to a runaway.</i>

661
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:45,280
<i>Her mother lives out here
in Addison County.</i>

662
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,535
- Mrs. Frank?
- Yeah?

663
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,412
I'm Claire.

664
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:56,917
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.

665
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,378
Just plain coffee.

666
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,257
- None of that mocha nonsense.
- Fine.

667
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,678
You look a little old for a student.

668
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:11,682
I'm not a student. We met at a party.

669
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,893
Well, that sounds about right.

670
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,147
I never understood how a girl
that wild got all A's.

671
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,400
She liked to read a lot, though.

672
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,529
Sometimes she'd lock herself up
in her room for days, just reading.

673
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:31,660
They wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young.

674
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,746
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

675
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,792
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.

676
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:43,255
She probably got it
from her father's side of the family.

677
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,176
She never really mentioned her father.

678
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,179
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.

679
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,182
She was 12 when he left.

680
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,643
Never spoke about him after that.

681
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,731
You don't even need the sound.

682
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,111
You can pretty much tell
what's happening by the faces.

683
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,365
I turn it up sometimes, though.

684
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,285
Feels like there's someone here.

685
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,248
Why are you here?

686
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,173
I don't know.

687
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:29,760
You want to see her room?

688
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,397
Full scholarship.

689
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,524
Princeton too.

690
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:48,153
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.

691
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,531
You must be so proud.

692
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,664
These are the last pictures
taken of her.

693
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,541
The police used this one.

694
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,170
Let me get that. Excuse me.

695
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,044
Claire?

696
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:50,901
Claire?

697
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:11,171
- Hello, Dr. Spencer.
- Mrs. Spencer.

698
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,383
Forbidden fruit.

699
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,014
You got a problem with that?

700
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:16,862
Guess this means you're not
mad at me anymore, huh?

701
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,072
I wouldn't go that far.

702
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,748
Take it easy, huh?

703
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,130
What's got into you?

704
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,262
- Ow!
- What's the matter?

705
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,389
It's too rough.

706
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,391
Since when?

707
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,440
This is a brand-new...

708
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:52,374
- Okay, Claire, that's...
- Why don't you shut up, professor?

709
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,002
Why don't you just...

710
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,630
...shut up?

711
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,210
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

712
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:20,879
Who?

713
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:24,966
Your wife.

714
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:27,594
Stop it!

715
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,317
You know.

716
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,069
What the hell are you doing?

717
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,613
I know.

718
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,868
I was there.

719
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,998
Just before the accident.

720
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,584
I remember now.

721
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:01,503
What?

722
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,963
I came to the door.

723
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,883
There was whispering.

724
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:10,011
I saw you in the mirror...

725
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,642
...lying there with her...

726
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,102
...in our house.

727
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:19,145
Claire, listen to me.

728
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,939
She was at the DuPont party...

729
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:23,566
...staring at me. It was her.

730
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,443
That's why I couldn't breathe.

731
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,987
That's why I dropped the glass.

732
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,865
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.

733
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,993
So you slept with a fucking student?

734
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,871
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Don't touch me.

735
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:38,873
Get away from me.

736
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,627
Get out!

737
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,255
I said, get out!

738
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:48,383
Fine.

739
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:51,511
Claire, please, please.

740
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,847
I gave up everything.

741
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,849
Claire, please don't...

742
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,519
- My life, my music.
- I never asked you to quit.

743
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,938
There was never any other choice!

744
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:05,483
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.

745
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,861
- Perfect family.
- That's not fair.

746
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,863
You were touring with a baby...

747
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,073
...and you were happy to give it up.

748
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,368
When you did, you hated me for it,
so you gave it all to her.

749
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:16,953
- Who?
- Caitlin!

750
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,204
Leave her out of this.

751
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,749
And then some bright
young woman finds me attractive.

752
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,751
- Stop it!
- And I slipped!

753
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:26,212
- God help me, I slipped!
- I'm not gonna listen.

754
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:31,092
- Claire, I tried to break it off.
- You should've tried harder.

755
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,269
I was in Adamant.

756
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,521
In Adamant?

757
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,734
You know, that artsy little hippie
village a couple hours away down on 7.

758
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:52,489
I stopped at this café to get coffee,
and I see Norman sitting in the back.

759
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,073
But he wasn't alone.

760
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,577
It was a young blond woman.

761
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,954
I didn't see her face.

762
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:02,248
I didn't think anything of it
at first.

763
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,001
And I was walking over to say hello.

764
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:11,257
And they started arguing
in such a way...

765
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:14,511
...that it stopped me.

766
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,474
Then a few days later,
you were in the accident.

767
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:23,144
And I get a bizarre call from Stan
working at the hospital...

768
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,730
...asking me, was I with you that day?

769
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:27,732
If you were upset about anything.

770
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,818
He made it sound
like you had deliberately...

771
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:32,570
...driven your car into a tree.

772
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,864
And I thought, "Oh, my God.

773
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,951
Claire's found out."

774
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,997
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.

775
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,504
And he was so desperate
at the thought...

776
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,217
...of losing you.

777
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,346
I couldn't say anything.

778
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,392
Please...

779
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,230
...don't hate me, Claire.

780
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,108
I don't hate you.

781
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,447
<i>Hello, this is Miss Jody.</i>

782
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:20,743
<i>Can't get to the phone. Leave your
name and I'll call you back.</i>

783
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:22,954
<i>Jody, it's Norman.</i>

784
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,374
<i>I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...</i>

785
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:29,752
<i>...ask her to call home, please?</i>

786
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,384
I can't talk to him.

787
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,889
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?

788
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,644
I have to ask him something.

789
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,877
Norman?

790
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:42,992
Norman?

791
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,122
Norman!

792
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,502
Oh, God!

793
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,964
- How's his blood pressure?
- 140/80.

794
01:17:57,215 --> 01:18:00,718
- How about his rhythm?
- Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.

795
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,720
- No sign of arrhythmia.
- Good.

796
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,390
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.

797
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,392
I'd still like to take you down.

798
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:09,018
I'm fine, really.

799
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:13,106
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend
a cardiac workup.

800
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:17,485
- I'll take care of that.
- He needs to sign the release form.

801
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,362
Thanks, guys.

802
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:23,366
They can take you for a CAT scan
tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.

803
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,368
I'm not going to the hospital...

804
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,246
...unless they have
a miracle drug for clumsiness.

805
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:30,331
Honey, I'm so sorry.

806
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:32,500
Thank God you came home.

807
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,377
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

808
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:37,004
You know, if that breaker
hadn't popped, he...

809
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:38,464
I know.

810
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,008
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.

811
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:44,345
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?

812
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:48,391
You might want to think twice
about keeping anything electrical...

813
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,977
- ...next to the tub.
- Oh, thank you.

814
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,689
Goodbye. Call me, okay?

815
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,516
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.

816
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:35,271
I want you to answer one question.

817
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:42,069
Did you have anything to do
with her disappearance?

818
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:44,739
Yes.

819
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,329
I had an affair with her.

820
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:56,375
And when I tried to break it off...

821
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:59,253
...she became unstable.

822
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,217
She came out here to the house.

823
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,012
She threatened to kill herself...

824
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,099
...or you.

825
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:18,064
I didn't think she'd
go through with any of it.

826
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:20,858
But then she...

827
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,445
She disappeared.

828
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:29,742
It was her, Norman.

829
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,369
She tried to kill you.

830
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,704
- Claire.
- You said it yourself.

831
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,581
She wanted you dead.

832
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:38,876
Are you saying I was attacked
by a ghost?

833
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:42,004
You had an affair with a girl...

834
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:47,093
...who threatened to kill herself, and
now there's a presence in our house.

835
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,638
A young, blond girl.

836
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,890
Don't you get it?

837
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,017
She did it, Norman.

838
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,644
She's dead...

839
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,814
...and now she's trying to hurt you
or both of us.

840
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:02,608
- You don't know that she's dead.
- Of course we do!

841
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:05,319
It's the only thing that makes...

842
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,365
Oh, God.

843
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,244
It's my fault. I...

844
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,246
I opened the door.

845
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:19,083
- Madison. I stole her hair.
- From where?

846
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,460
- And it gave her power.
- Claire.

847
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:26,132
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.

848
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,385
It was an accident. I'm fine.

849
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,889
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?

850
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,766
- Yes.
- Claire, say it.

851
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:39,103
Say it:
"It was an accident.

852
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,855
It's not my fault."

853
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,233
Say it, Claire.

854
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,570
I need to go lie down.

855
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,324
I didn't sleep last night,
and I need to lie down.

856
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,329
I want to be alone for a while.

857
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:19,393
<i>Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.</i>

858
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:23,606
What's the name of that friend of
yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?

859
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:27,193
The guy that does the paranormal
psych stuff?

860
01:22:27,485 --> 01:22:28,986
Holodnik.

861
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:34,116
Could you contact him and ask him
to give me a call here?

862
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:37,203
I'd really like to talk to him today.

863
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,734
Hello.

864
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,069
Yes, this is he.

865
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,113
Thanks for calling back.

866
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:59,869
No, sir. That was my father.

867
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,207
Yeah, he passed away
a couple of years ago.

868
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,252
Yes, he was. Thank you.

869
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:12,089
Look, the reason I'm calling is...

870
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,009
I'm a little out of my depth here.

871
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:18,471
Someone who is very close to me...

872
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,474
...believes herself to be
or seems to be...

873
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,726
...in contact with some kind of...

874
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,896
...entity or spirit, and...

875
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:32,610
No, there's no...

876
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,237
...no history of delusional behavior.

877
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:42,953
Well, I guess what I'm asking is,
is it possible that she could be...

878
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,248
...causing these manifestations...

879
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:51,504
...through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic...?

880
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:59,345
Is there anything else
that it could be?

881
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,395
And this has been documented?

882
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:12,733
Really?

883
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,114
I'm sorry,
but could I call you back...

884
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:20,241
...or have you call me back?

885
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,368
Please, yes, that'll be great.

886
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:23,994
Thank you, sir.

887
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:28,999
Claire!

888
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:33,731
You all right, Claire?

889
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,065
The braid!

890
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,236
Where's the braid?

891
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,238
What are you talking about?

892
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,742
What are you talking about?
This?

893
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,994
Is this what you're talking about?

894
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:51,332
- Where'd you get this?
- I took it from Madison's house.

895
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,752
This is hers?

896
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,379
This is Madison Frank's hair?

897
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:19,985
What do you think?

898
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,572
I really don't know.

899
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:28,994
Norman.

900
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,626
Yes...

901
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,129
...I believe you.

902
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:00,734
Hey, Coop.

903
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:30,889
You're playing.

904
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:35,019
She's gone.

905
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:38,230
How do you know?

906
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,191
I can feel it.

907
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:52,619
I picked up the book you ordered
at the bookstore.

908
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:05,257
Claire, I don't know how to apologize
to you for what I've done.

909
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,475
But if you give me another chance...

910
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:20,814
...I promise I'll spend the rest of my
life making you glad that you did.

911
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:35,746
Please.

912
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,016
Last sail of the year.

913
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:57,893
Beautiful, isn't it?

914
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:01,605
We ought to take a drive
before the leaves all disappear.

915
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:05,734
- Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
- Look for antiques.

916
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:08,237
Yeah, we haven't
done that for a while.

917
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,240
Adamant.

918
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:16,120
- Adamant?
- An artsy little village down 7.

919
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,372
Supposed to be charming.

920
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:21,500
- Do you know it?
- No.

921
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,004
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.

922
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:47,192
What's that for?

923
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:49,361
Nothing.

924
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,741
God, oh, God...

925
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,988
You don't understand what that is.

926
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:22,991
Don't I, Norman?

927
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:26,244
That's Madison's necklace.

928
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,458
You killed her, didn't you?

929
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,378
I did not.

930
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,255
I didn't kill anyone.

931
01:34:39,633 --> 01:34:41,343
Jesus, Claire.

932
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:42,761
Listen to me.

933
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,889
When I got here...

934
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:50,268
...she was already dead. She killed
herself in our house to destroy me.

935
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:52,729
Do you think I'm stupid?

936
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,358
She left that for you in the garden,
with a letter.

937
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:59,236
I burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake.

938
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:01,738
A week before...

939
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,951
...she showed up at the DuPont party.

940
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:09,996
I was terrified.

941
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:14,000
She insisted, so I agreed
to meet her here.

942
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:16,128
When I got here...

943
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,213
...she had taken pills.

944
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,717
I tried to revive her, but...

945
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:24,344
...she was gone.

946
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:27,264
There was nothing I could do.

947
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:31,977
So I put her in her car...

948
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:34,479
...and I drove to the boat ramp...

949
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:37,941
...and I rolled it out into the lake.

950
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:41,486
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.

951
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:43,613
But tell me, Claire.

952
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:46,825
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?

953
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:48,702
Our marriage?

954
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:52,873
My work,
which I spent my whole life on?

955
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,002
Tell me, Claire.

956
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:01,381
Tell me, please. Because we can
put this behind us.

957
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:03,759
Our life can go on.

958
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:05,510
It's not too late.

959
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:11,391
What are you asking me to do?

960
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:16,146
I'm asking you to forgive me.

961
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:32,496
That girl must be brought up.

962
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:06,238
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.

963
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,365
I have some information...

964
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:10,492
...about a missing person.

965
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:13,245
Madison Frank, yes.

966
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:17,749
Could you send an officer
out to the house, please?

967
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:22,379
15 Willoughby Lane.

968
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,756
It's about a mile from the bridge.

969
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,467
Okay.

970
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:29,761
Thank you.

971
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,111
I'm gonna go get dressed.

972
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,739
<i>Information. What city?</i>

973
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:03,707
Don't!

974
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:07,210
Stop it!

975
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:11,608
I begged you, Claire.

976
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,195
I pleaded with you.

977
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:22,368
But you wouldn't let it go.

978
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:27,749
Oh, Claire.

979
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:33,004
I never wanted any of this to happen.

980
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,132
All I ever wanted...

981
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,969
...was for you to love me.

982
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:43,264
Be proud of me.

983
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,518
To be happy.

984
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:51,481
She was going to go to the dean.

985
01:41:52,232 --> 01:41:53,942
She would have ruined us.

986
01:41:55,485 --> 01:41:58,238
Did she think I was just
gonna sit there...

987
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:00,490
...and watch it happen?

988
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,622
You have no idea what it was like.

989
01:42:07,956 --> 01:42:09,999
Hold her underwater...

990
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:15,255
...watch her life slip away.

991
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,514
But she gave me no choice.

992
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:36,609
And neither have you.

993
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,994
I can't figure out
how you put it all together.

994
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:48,872
At first I thought you knew.

995
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:53,501
Thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap.

996
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,838
Then I realized you believed it.

997
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:00,633
It was a passive-aggressive
masterpiece.

998
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:06,890
The first time I met you...

999
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:11,394
...all I ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1000
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:15,732
It's not gonna happen now.

1001
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:51,643
Too cold.

1002
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,481
I almost froze to death laying here...

1003
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:00,360
...wet, naked, pretending to be
electrocuted.

1004
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:02,612
Hey, Coop.

1005
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,490
How you doing? How you doing, boy?

1006
01:44:05,698 --> 01:44:08,117
Let's go get your ball. Come on.

1007
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:28,763
Jody, it's Norman.

1008
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,099
If you're there, pick up, please.

1009
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,518
It's Norman.

1010
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,521
Listen, Claire and I...

1011
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:39,565
...had a terrible blowout.

1012
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:41,234
Could you do me a favor?

1013
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:44,821
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could
you check on her in the morning?

1014
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:46,990
I'm worried about her.

1015
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,368
Thanks.

1016
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,769
The halothane's starting to wear off.

1017
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,360
I'm sure in some...

1018
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:28,239
...tragic way,
your suicide is gonna...

1019
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:32,118
...help bring Caitlin and I
closer together.

1020
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:37,123
And every time I look at her...

1021
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,001
...I'll see you.

1022
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:48,134
Oh, God.

1023
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:13,826
What's this?

1024
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:46,977
Oh, shit.

1025
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:04,244
I'm on the bridge!

1026
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,205
Somebody help me!

1027
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:09,208
I'm on the bridge!

1028
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,206
No!

1029
01:59:40,007 --> 01:59:42,092
I beg you...

1030
01:59:42,259 --> 01:59:43,594
...think of Caitlin.

1031
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,846
Please, don't. Please.

1032
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:48,448
